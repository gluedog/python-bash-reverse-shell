# python-bash-reverse-shell
A fully functional server-client reverse shell. Built it for Android phones to quickly gain root, without having to install additional programs like Magisk
You do need to enable root debugging mode, connect your phone to your PC (with developer options and root debugging enabled). 
Then run the shell in the background and have your client ready (preferably in your $PATH)

Now you can gain root from termux whenever you want, without having to have your phone connected to the PC via USB anymore.
